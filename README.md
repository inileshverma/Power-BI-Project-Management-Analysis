# Spectra-Tiles-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS PowerBI)
## Project Objective
This project focuses on analyzing multiple projects' costs, benefits, and completion rates using Power BI. The objective is to track key metrics such as project completion, cost, benefits, and phases, helping project managers make data-driven decisions and optimize resource allocation.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/inileshverma/Power-BI-Project-Management-Analysis/blob/main/Project%20Management.pbix">Dataset</a>

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Project Completion Rate – Measures how much of the project is completed (0.87 in the given dashboard).
- Total Project Benefit – The cumulative financial benefit generated by all projects (8.83M).
- Total Project Cost – The total cost incurred across projects (4.16M).
- Project Benefits by Region – Analysis of financial benefits distributed across different regions (North, South, East, and West).
- Project Cost by Region – Breakdown of project costs for each region.
- Project Phases Distribution – The number of projects in each phase (e.g., Implementation, Development, etc.).
- Cost and Benefit Over Time – A comparative analysis of project costs vs. benefits across different years (2021–2025).
- Project Summary – Overview of different projects, their types, status (In-Progress or Cancelled), and financial impact.

## Process
- Data Collection – Gathered raw project data, including cost, benefit, phases, and regions.
- Data Cleaning & Transformation – Ensured data consistency, removed null values, and categorized projects properly.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Conducted an in-depth review to identify cost-benefit trends and project performance.
- Dashboard Creation in Power BI – Built interactive visuals like:
Cards (KPIs) for Project Completion, Cost, and Benefits.
Pie Charts for Regional Cost & Benefits Analysis.
Bar Charts for Project Phases and Cost-Benefit Trends over time.
Project Filters for dynamic selection (e.g., by Year, Project Type).
- Final Insights & Documentation – Compiled findings to assist in project performance evaluation.

## Project Insight
1. Project Performance Overview
The project completion rate is 0.87, indicating most projects are nearing completion.
The total project benefit (8.83M) significantly outweighs the total project cost (4.16M), showing a positive return on investment.
2. Regional Cost and Benefits Distribution
The North and West regions show the highest financial benefits from projects.
Project costs are more evenly distributed across East, South, and North regions.
3. Project Phases
The majority of projects are in Phase 4 (Implementation) and Phase 5 (Monitoring & Evaluation), meaning many projects are in their final stages.
Phase 2 (Development) also has a high count, showing a balanced pipeline of new and ongoing projects.
4. Yearly Cost vs. Benefit Trends
The dashboard shows an increase in project benefits over the years, peaking in 2022 (0.24bn).
Project costs have fluctuated, suggesting variations in budget allocation across different years.
5. Project Types and Status
Projects fall under categories like Cost Reduction, Income Generation, Process Improvement, and Working Capital Improvement.
Some projects (e.g., A Triumph of Software, Active Achievement) are cancelled, which may indicate budget constraints or feasibility issues.

## Final Conclusion:
Through this project, I successfully developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides insights into project performance. Key takeaways include:
- Most projects are in the final implementation phase, with a high completion rate (0.87).
- Financial benefits (8.83M) significantly exceed total costs (4.16M), indicating positive project returns.
- Regional cost and benefit distribution helps in optimizing budget allocation.
- Analyzing yearly trends enables better financial planning and risk assessment.

This project enhances project monitoring and strategic decision-making, helping organizations prioritize high-impact projects and optimize resources.
